{4 attached Json Files}

Indian Dataset is obtained in code itself, with api calls.

API_KEY used for LLM calls is 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
This API_KEY has limited usage.

Be sure to install required modules as mentioned in the code.

Usage of GPU in preferred for better execution.

Outputs of the code will be saved in local path, in the form of CSV Files.

Also find attached are Outputs for a sample run.
companies_with_aspect.csv is an example of Aspect extraction
companies_with_sentiment.csv is an example of Sentiment extracted through both the models.
final_sentiment.csv is an example of net sentiment of sentences in dataset.
final_validness.csv is showing the movement with respect to predicted sentiment.
